# cygwin-gcc-linux

I have cywin-gcc-linux software package that is a cross compiler to build executables running on i686 single board computers with Liux Kernel 2.4.x. This software pacakge needs to be installed on Windows 7 (32bit) with Cygwin. 
If you  need to use it, please contact me any time. I would like to share it with you. 
It is over 25 MB, so it cannot be uploaded here. 
Email me if you want it @ chendingjun68@gmail.com
